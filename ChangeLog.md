# ChangeLog

## 3.0.1

Keychain 3.0.1 continues to improve macOS `--confirm` UI dialog support. When `--confirm` is used on macOS, it now implies `--no-inherit`, to ensure that Keychain is able to initialize its own `ssh-agent` that is properly configured to use the macOS native Keychain confirm dialog (addresses #227).

In addition, cancelling GPG signing key warming no longer results in control characters being displayed on the terminal (fixes #228).

Added `--immediate` to skip "Press Enter to initialize keys" prompt (addresses #230). When requested keys are missing, the first Keychain to acquire the lock will run `ssh-add` immediately instead of first requiring Enter. This is technically safe, but no longer Keychain's default behavior since it's sub-optimal for some user scenarios. This can be enabled persistently via the `[agent] immediate = true` `~/.keychainrc` configuration option.

Corrected `keychain man` pager integration (addresses #231). Color will be enabled when `less` is specifically detected, and `-R` will be enabled when not the default. Otherwise, `keychain man` output will not have color sequences. This fixes man page output on several systems.

### GnuPG Scope Adjustment

Keychain 3.0.1 also includes an important change -- the scope of its GnuPG integration has been deliberately narrowed, for using `gpg-agent` as a drop-in replacement for `ssh-agent` has been removed (addresses #164).

While this may seem counterintuitive, this decision was made to improve security. When loading an encrypted SSH key with this feature enabled, `ssh-add`, invoked by Keychain, prompted for the key's original passphrase. If the key was not already present in GnuPG's private-key store, GnuPG *then requested a new passphrase through Pinentry and stored a persistent copy*. A user unfamiliar with this behavior who simply wanted to use `gpg-agent` in place of `ssh-agent` may not have understood why GnuPG was requesting another passphrase, and not realize that this new passphrase would be used to re-encrypt their private key in GnuPG's on-disk persistent key store, thus duplicating it.

Even more unfortunate, the GnuPG passphrase request for the **re-encryption** happens right after the user supplied a passphrase for **decryption**, not as a separate flow, adding to the potential confusion. It's very possible that the user might hit Enter and submit an empty passphrase for the second unexpected prompt, potentially leaving the imported GnuPG copy without passphrase protection on disk.

The conclusion I came to is that GnuPG's `ssh-agent` protocol compatibility functions are more of an SSH private key importer/bridge which exclusively uses GnuPG's own key store, rather than a drop-in replacement for `ssh-agent` -- so we shouldn't treat it as if it is a drop-in replacement. While I could instead have tried to smooth over the rough edges with GnuPG, I would be fighting against GnuPG's intended architecture too much, so it's best to simply define a clear boundary of what it makes sense to support and not support.

Keychain will continue to support `gpgs:`, `gpge:`, and `gpga:` for proving and warming native GPG signing and decryption capabilities. You can still use `keychain wipe --gpg` to flush its in-memory secret cache. This remains supported and does not remove persistent key material. Keychain will invoke GnuPG for those operations, but it will no longer start, configure, adopt, or otherwise manage the `gpg-agent` lifecycle. Consider Keychain an orchestrator of `ssh-agent`'s lifecycle, and *a helpful utility* for GnuPG key warming, **but no longer responsible for `gpg-agent`'s lifecycle**.

This gives Keychain a clear boundary:

- Keychain manages `ssh-agent` and SSH keys.
- Keychain supports warming native GPG signing and decryption capabilities.
- GnuPG remains responsible for `gpg-agent`, Pinentry, configuration, and lifecycle.
- `gpg-agent` is not supported as a substitute for `ssh-agent`.

Upgrading will not remove any SSH private keys that were previously imported into GnuPG's persistent key store. Users who previously enabled this behavior should review their GnuPG key storage separately. You can do this by looking in `~/.gnupg/sshcontrol` for imported keygrips (40 character hex), and then looking for equivalent `~/.gnupg/private-keys-v1.d/<keygrip>.key` files. If `gpg-connect-agent 'KEYINFO --ssh-list --ssh-fpr=sha256' /bye` lists any keys with "C" in the protection field, it means the key is not protected with a passphrase. It is recommended that you remove these keys via `gpg-connect-agent "DELETE_KEY <keygrip>" /bye` and then remove the corresponding entry in `~/.gnupg/sshcontrol`, making sure you are not deleting any private keys that might be associated with a native OpenPGP key.

The following GnuPG-related changes were made:

- Removed the behavior previously selected by `--ssh-allow-gpg` and `--ssh-spawn-gpg`. The command-line spellings remain accepted as deprecated, warning no-ops so existing scripts continue to run. Inherited GnuPG SSH sockets are ignored, and conventional SSH keys are handled only by `ssh-agent`.
- Left `gpg-agent` startup, configuration, pinentry, and lifecycle entirely to GnuPG. Keychain no longer launches or validates the daemon and no longer exposes `gpg_args` or `KEYCHAIN_GPG_AGENT_ARGS`.
- Changed bare `keychain wipe` to clear SSH-agent identities only. Flushing `gpg-agent`'s entire in-memory secret cache now requires an explicit `--gpg`; legacy `--wipe all` retains its original both-target behavior. No persistent key material is removed.
- Separated GPG credential warm-up from SSH multi-terminal coordination. Keychain now performs each requested signing or decryption proof exactly once instead of using real signing operations as repeated status probes.
- Restored `--quick` as a deterministic SSH-only compatibility shortcut. GPG key arguments are ignored under `--quick`; Keychain does not invoke GnuPG, while still establishing the SSH-agent environment.
- Made `wipe --gpg` authoritative and idempotent. An absent agent is a successful no-op, while missing tooling, timeouts, transport failures, agent errors, and unconfirmed responses now fail with actionable diagnostics.
- Made GPG credential warm-up authoritative. Signing and decryption failures now identify the affected key and operation, decryption stops immediately when its encryption proof cannot be prepared, and successful decryption is verified against the original plaintext.

## 3.0.0

First stable release of Keychain 3.

Keychain 3 is a ground-up Python 3 evolution of Daniel Robbins' long-running
SSH-agent orchestrator with native GPG credential support. It preserves
Keychain's single-file deployment model as a single-file, self-contained
`keychain.pyz` (see
[Python Rationale](/docs/python-rationale.md)), while replacing the historical
Bourne shell implementation with a tested, auditable Python package. It
requires Python 3.9 or newer and has no third-party runtime dependencies.

The 3.0.0 release incorporates the work delivered through all three public
betas. Highlights include:

- **One coordinated agent experience across terminals and sessions.**
  Keychain discovers, validates, starts, and reconnects to a long-running
  agent per user and host. Managed `ssh-agent` sockets now live at stable,
  host-specific paths under `~/.keychain/`, avoiding fragile temporary socket
  directories.

- **Coordinated multi-terminal initialization.** When several shells discover
  missing keys at the same time, they cooperate instead of racing for a lock
  or displaying duplicate passphrase prompts. Any waiting terminal can take
  over an inaccessible prompt, and all participants are notified when key
  loading completes.

- **A modern interface with strong 2.x compatibility.** The action-oriented
  command surface includes `add`, `agent`, `list`, `env`, `inspect`, `help`,
  and `man`. Traditional Keychain 2.x invocations remain supported through an
  explicit compatibility layer; intentional differences are documented under
  `keychain man topic:compat`.

- **Broader SSH and GPG workflows.** Keychain can load PKCS#11 providers for
  smartcards and hardware tokens, and explicitly warm GPG signing, encryption,
  and decryption credentials. Verification failures are reported instead of
  being mistaken for success.

- **Native macOS confirmation support.** When `--confirm` is used with a new
  Keychain-managed `ssh-agent`, Keychain installs a private, confirmation-only
  `osascript` helper and gives OpenSSH a zero-dependency, native macOS
  Allow/Deny dialog for each key use. It works entirely with facilities built
  into macOS, with no additional askpass package or graphical toolkit to
  install. Denial, cancellation, a missing desktop session, or helper failure
  all fail closed. `--confirm` and `--no-gui` are intentionally incompatible.

- **Configuration, inspection, and embedded documentation.** Persistent
  preferences may live in an optional `~/.keychainrc`; `keychain inspect` exposes resolved
  runtime state in human-readable or JSON form; and the complete, versioned
  manual ships inside the zipapp with topic and option-level help (`keychain man` and `keychain man --list`).

- **Hardened state handling and testing.** Agent sockets, pidfiles, locks,
  coordination state, and waiter endpoints are ownership- and permission-
  checked. The test suite covers modern and legacy CLI behavior, real SSH and
  GPG integration, multi-terminal coordination, and supported platform
  differences.

Changes since `3.0.0_beta3`:

- Added zero-dependency, native macOS `--confirm` dialog support (#222).
- Made `--confirm --no-gui` fail explicitly.
- Fixed an issue where `--quiet` suppressed the prompt to press Enter to
  initialize keys (#223).
- Expanded `inspect` with `.keychainrc` status, effective settings and their
  sources, runtime identity, and relevant environment state. `inspect --json`
  now emits a versioned diagnostic report suitable for bug reports.
- Completed a dedicated security hardening pass across runtime storage,
  configuration, agent handling, and generated shell output. Keychain now
  rejects unsafe ownership or permissions on `.keychainrc` and runtime files,
  validates SSH endpoints before use, rechecks agent identity before stopping
  it, writes private state atomically, quotes exports for each target shell,
  and rejects unsafe control characters.
- Reworked concurrent initialization around operating-system advisory locks.
  Lock ownership and liveness no longer depend on PID heuristics; locks are
  released automatically when the owning process exits, and abandoned
  activation handoffs are safely reconciled.
- Hardened the release pipeline with commit-pinned GitHub Actions, verified
  release artifacts, and automatically generated SHA256 checksums.
- Converted command timeouts, malformed agent arguments, and operating-system
  failures into concise user errors instead of Python tracebacks (#224).
- Corrected askpass environment handling to follow OpenSSH's `DISPLAY`,
  `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, and `SSH_ASKPASS_REQUIRE=force` rules.
- Strengthened GPG warm-up verification so `gpga:` proves both signing and
  decryption capability before reporting success, and made decrypt verification
  portable by avoiding `/dev/null` as the temporary encrypted payload.
- Expanded end-to-end SSH confirmation and agent startup coverage.
- Shortened managed `ssh-agent` socket names to avoid UNIX-domain socket path
  limits on macOS, Linux, and other POSIX systems.
- Extensive code cleanups throughout the codebase (removing deprecated code, simplifying logic where possible, etc.)

Prior Keychain 3 beta users on MacOS will need to restart `ssh-agent` and Keychain completely in order to use the new `--confirm` functionality. Run
`keychain agent stop` once, then start Keychain normally. This will initialize the new graphical `--confirm` support. You will now be prompted with a graphical dialog to allow or deny each use of the cached key.

## 3.0.0_beta3

Third public beta of Keychain 3.x, collecting changes made after the
`3.0.0_beta2` tag.

This release focuses on feature additions and robustness. It makes Keychain
more dependable during shell startup, easier to configure,
supports smartcards or other PKCS#11-backed SSH tokens, closes
a known `.keychainrc` documentation gap, and significantly enhances
the integrated documentation and documentation rendering.

Highlights:

- **More reliable agent startup.** Keychain now keeps its managed `ssh-agent`
  socket in a stable location under `~/.keychain/` instead of depending on
  temporary `/tmp/ssh-*` paths. This helps avoid cases where the agent is
  still running but its socket directory has been cleaned up, a problem that
  showed up clearly under WSL but is not unique to it.

- **Better smartcard and hardware-token support.** You can now ask Keychain to
  load a PKCS#11 provider directly with `pkcs11:/path/to/provider.so`. This is
  useful for SSH keys stored on smartcards, security keys, and similar devices.
  This addresses issue #216.

- Improved Documentation Formatting. Significant improvements in the
  embedded documentation renderer used by `keychain man`. Pager support
  integrated. Supported .keychainrc config settings are now fully
  documented, streamlined and available. Addresses issue #217.

- **Improved 2.9.8 compatibility details.** A few legacy command-line edge
  cases with `--stop` and `--wipe` now print a more accurate error message.

  Robbins, the person, removing reference to BreezyOps / Funtoo Solutions,
  Inc.

## 3.0.0_beta2

Second public beta of Keychain 3.x, collecting all changes made after the
`3.0.0_beta1` tag.

This release transforms the multi-terminal experience and strengthens GPG key
handling. The headline feature is a coordinated unlock protocol that eliminates
the frustrating "could not acquire lock" errors when multiple shells start
simultaneously -- a common occurrence when Visual Studio Code reconnects to
WSL and restores several terminals at once.

Highlights:

- **Coordinated multi-terminal initialization (solves issue #214).** Keychain
  now uses an elegant coordination protocol instead of the classic lock-timeout
  race. When multiple terminals detect missing SSH keys:

  - All terminals display: `Press Enter to initialize keys`
  - Pressing Enter in *any* terminal runs `ssh-add` in that terminal
  - Other terminals wait automatically and are notified when initialization completes
  - Waiting terminals print `Keys initialized by another terminal.` and configure
    their environment without prompting

  This eliminates the `could not acquire lock` errors that plagued earlier
  versions. The technical implementation uses a short-lived state lock for
  metadata updates, a dedicated activation lock to elect the loader, and FIFO
  endpoints for instant kernel-level notification (no polling). A takeover
  mechanism allows any waiting terminal to cancel a stuck `ssh-add` by typing
  `takeover`, ensuring you're never blocked by a hidden or inaccessible prompt.
  Internal coordination is quiet -- no more `Waiting N seconds for lock...`
  messages during interactive key loading.

- **Improved startup and key-loading output.**
  - Multi-key `ssh-add` prompts render as compact lists instead of long inline
    messages
  - Common stale pidfile/socket cases (especially in WSL restart scenarios) are
    folded into the `Starting ssh-agent...` context instead of producing
    separate noisy notes
  - Empty `gpg-agent` wipe diagnostics no longer render awkward `(output: )`
    text; non-actionable no-agent details are debug output
  - Successful remote initialization is reported as `Keys initialized by another
    terminal.`

- **Reliable GPG warm-up with explicit verification.** The `gpge:KEYID` and
  `gpga:KEYID` extended key syntax now perform a complete encrypt-then-decrypt
  verification cycle instead of relying on signing warm-up side effects. A tiny
  temporary payload is encrypted to the requested key and immediately decrypted
  through `gpg-agent`. If this verification cannot be completed, `add` fails
  rather than reporting success. This is significantly more reliable across
  different GnuPG versions and key configurations, where signing warm-up may
  not populate the decryption passphrase cache. The legacy `gpgk:KEYID` alias
  remains equivalent to `gpgs:KEYID` (signing warm-up only).

- **Enhanced documentation.** The embedded man page now includes comprehensive
  coverage of the coordination model (`keychain man topic:coordination`),
  updated guidance for `--lockwait` and `--no-lock` options, and clearer
  explanations of GPG warm-up guarantees. New design documents and a formal
  UX acceptance checklist support manual multi-terminal testing.

- **Focused test coverage.** New tests validate the coordination state file,
  waiter FIFO registration, activation lock handoff, takeover/cancel mechanics,
  and GPG end-to-end warm-up for both signing and encryption/decryption paths.
  Test infrastructure improvements ensure the checkout's source code is tested
  rather than any installed version, and CI coverage now includes macOS GPG
  validation.

Beta notes:

- The coordinated unlock flow applies to SSH key loading only. GPG keys use
  explicit warm-up paths (`gpgs:`, `gpge:`, `gpga:`) and do not participate
  in multi-terminal coordination.
- Terminal prompt erasing is best-effort: used on ANSI-capable terminals,
  falling back to ordinary line output when stderr is redirected, `TERM=dumb`,
  or the prompt would wrap.

## 3.0.0_beta1

Initial public beta of Keychain 3.x.

Keychain 3 is a ground-up Python 3 rewrite of Daniel Robbins' long-running
SSH-agent manager with native GPG credential support. The release preserves
the traditional single-file deployment model through `keychain.pyz`, while
replacing the historical Bourne shell implementation with a tested, auditable
Python package.

Highlights:

- Ships as a standalone `keychain.pyz` with no third-party runtime
  dependencies.
- Requires Python 3.9 or newer at runtime; the zipapp bootstrap can re-exec
  into a newer `python3.NN` on systems where `/usr/bin/env python3` is below
  the floor.
- Adds an action-oriented command surface such as `keychain add`,
  `keychain agent start`, `keychain agent stop`, `keychain list`,
  `keychain env`, `keychain inspect`, `keychain help`, and `keychain man`.
- Keeps keychain 2.x-style invocations working through an explicit
  compatibility layer.
- Embeds documentation in the zipapp; use `keychain man` and
  `keychain man --list` to browse it.
- Uses a default-deny model for `KEYCHAIN_*` environment variables; pass
  `--allow-env` / `-E` when legacy environment-variable behavior is desired.
- Releases under GPLv3 for the 3.x series. Keychain 2.x remains GPLv2.

Known beta notes:

- WSL login-shell startup can run keychain in a noninteractive/no-TTY context
  when invoked by automation. This may fall through to `ssh_askpass`; stale
  WSL `/tmp/ssh-*` sockets and hostname-specific pidfiles are tracked for
  follow-up polish.
